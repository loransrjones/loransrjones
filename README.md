- 👋 Hi, I’m @loransrjones
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, period! For here, currently, I'm interested in Java because I'm teaching it and learning newer programming languages that I haven't used much.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Responsible Research and Innovation through EdX. I'm also reading System Error, a book that explains the problem of our obsession with optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on class projects with my students for now. Maybe more later. Family life has me busy.
- 📫 How to reach me: through here for now.
